                    In addressing the challenges posed by social media on youth safety, a multi-faceted approach is essential. Educating young users about online risks, promoting responsible digital citizenship, and fostering open communication between parents, educators, and adolescents can significantly contribute to a safer online environment. Additionally, stringent privacy measures and robust security features implemented by social media platforms can act as a barrier against cyber threats. Striking a delicate balance between technological innovation and user protection is key to harnessing the positive potential of social media while mitigating its adverse effects on the well-being of the younger generation.
