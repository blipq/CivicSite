                While the internet can be a great resource for children's learning and development, it can often fall short of this idealized version of the internet. Technological advancements have created a very efficient way to share information, but this can negatively affect the youth even when they are grown up as well. The extremely accessible content that is made online may lead to a dependency on the dopamine it creates, with parents allowing their childrenâ€™s developmental years to be controlled by screens. This trend raises privacy concerns as well. Especially when children lack a full understanding of their online activities, and how dangerous it can be for a naive child to give out personal information. Unrestricted access to the internet poses significant safety risks for children navigating the internet without regulations. It is crucial to bring light to the disregard for child safety and reconsider how the internet is used by children, as it can negatively affect their lives even into adulthood.
