                Social media is useful for entertainment, developing communities, and as a tool to connect. However, social media has negative effects, including on children, who may be most vulnerable. In using social media a child may experience negative impacts to their mental health. As a result, children may feel inadequate, self-doubting, or depressed. Children may feel pressure to conform to online standards of popularity and beauty and may experience negative impacts to their social and emotional health.

                In using social media, children may be exposed to inappropriate content and cyber-harassment. Because users may contribute anonymously online, some users may engage in verbal abuse, deprecation, or threats. Children may feel unsafe or insecure as a result of cyber-bullying. Parents and guardians have significant responsibilities in mitigating such exposure. Parents may monitor computer usage and dialog with their children about online experiences.

                Excessive use of social media can impact children's education, academic performance, creativity, expression, and productivity. Social media can be addictive. Children addicted to social media may use social media to procrastinate on daily activities or sleep. Notifications, updates, and peer interactions are distracting from other daily activities. It is essential to seek a balance between the benefits of being connected online and the well-being of vulnerable children.
