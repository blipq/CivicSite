                        Initially, the group ran into some trouble trying to narrow down what we wanted our topic to be for our project because we were unable to communicate effectively through the canvas chat system and we did not have a firm understanding as to what the prompt “Human interactions with technology” really meant. After we collaborated and decided to move all communication to a different software, we were able to narrow our topic down to the negative impact of social media on the youth.

                        We divided up the roles accordingly to maximize our time effectively. We each selected a different issue related to the negative impact of social media and we researched our portion before collaborating what we found to the group. My section primarily focused on how media can become addictive and how that can be detrimental to one’s health or success. We agreed to include a solution to the section which we researched and everyone did so and compiled it in the main page.

                        Despite the authors of each section of the web page varying, I collaborated with the team and I agree with all the points that they made both about the negative effects and the solutions that they presented. Overall, I believe that social media is a wonderful invention that has been used positively to connect people and help them socialize from a distance, but it can easily be used to harm its users through its various negative effects that have been presented by my group with this project.
