                Social media is a vibrant place. It’s an environment where people can share information and
                content about their interests, work, life, and beliefs. When you see it for its core values, it’s
                almost beautiful. However, there is no good without the bad, and this free, almost anonymous
                landscape is not without its fair share of it.

                With the rise of popular content-sharing services, comes the rise of children using them. While
                occasionally this can be seen as positive, I believe it to be negative. Many children lack the
                understanding of many things shared on these services, and even the consequences of them.
                At such a young age, it’s easy to overlook the responsibility of privacy, safety, and
                communication. Children are also more impressionable, more likely to be convinced to do or
                share something they shouldn’t. They also have more access to content considered
                inappropriate for their age, or even material that’s explicit to all audiences. Because children are
                often allowed unsupervised access, it’s increasingly difficult for parents to protect their children
                from unwanted exposure. It is for these reasons I believe children should not have access to
                social media, at least until they reach a mature enough age.
