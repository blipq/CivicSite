                    It’s safe to say that the internet has opened many doors in the realm of innovation across
                    the globe, but that level of confidence cannot be shared with the well-being of children who have
                    access to the world-wide web. As social media continues to grow in popularity, so too does the
                    risk of harm and exposure to inappropriate content on these platforms. With most of these
                    services allowing users of all ages to join, the safety of children utilizing them is seldom
                    guaranteed. While many media sites limit access to harmful material, none of them can protect
                    their users from other users. The risk of being socially attacked or even hacked is far too great.
                    Children may unknowingly share private information about their system and accounts, or share
                    too much about themselves or their family, giving bad actors all they need to execute their
                    malicious intent. Even if a child was perfectly safe on the internet, their presence may only exist
                    to get away from a poor relationship with their family, or to give said family a moment of silence,
                    as a form of pacification, ultimately neglecting their responsibilities as parents or guardians.
                    As it is impossible to monitor even just the five percent of the open-web we use on a
                    daily basis, no one can guarantee the safety of children from inappropriate and explicit material.
                    Social media today has moderate protection against this content, but no site is able to
                    completely eliminate it. With pop culture being highly discussed on social media, and much of it
                    intended for more mature audiences, children will find it challenging to avoid it; in fact, they will
                    likely be drawn to it, as it is considered popular and important. Additionally, with many children
                    having unrestricted access to the internet, this material is often shared between children.
                    According to Internetmatters.org, roughly 1 in 4 children online have been sent explicit content
                    by their peers, and over 9 in 10 children have been exposed to this content by the age of 14.
                    These numbers make it clear that social media has a very unfortunate grip on the new
                    generation.
                    Not all media sites are negative, or at least unnecessary for children and young adults.
                    Some useful ones include educational forum pages, like Quizlet, Khan Academy, Quora, and
                    Stack Overflow. Asking questions and seeking help in these social platforms are generally
                    accompanied with positive assistance and feedback, but it isn’t unlikely for someone to respond
                    harshly, and act deprecative. This kind of behavior is even more common on less regulated
                    sites, such as major social media outlets. Users can harass, attack, and even belittle others,
                    especially children, as there are little to no repercussions to their actions. This is because the
                    internet grants individuals a sense of anonymity, making children easy targets to this kind of
                    behavior. With social media constantly growing, and with almost no connections to an
                    individual’s physical presence, it’s the perfect place for cyberbullying.
                    The influence of social media on today's youth is undeniable, bringing in an era of
                    unprecedented connectivity but also introducing quite a few security and safety concerns. As
                    the digital landscape continues to evolve, the youth find themselves navigating a complex
                    terrain, where personal information is often shared without a full understanding of the potential
                    consequences. The constant connection shared can overshadow the risks associated with
                    online platforms, exposing the youth to issues like cyberbullying, identity theft, and privacy
                    breaches. The boundary between the virtual and real worlds becomes blurred, raising questions
                    about the long-term impact on mental health and self-esteem. As social media platforms
                    become breeding grounds for misinformation and predators, addressing these security and
                    safety challenges is of utmost importance. Finding a balance between fostering a sense of
                    community and ensuring the protection of the youth requires a concerted effort from both
                    platform developers and parents alike. Only through an all encompassing approach, that
                    includes education on online safety, robust privacy settings, and vigilant monitoring, can we
                    hope to change the effects of social media on the welfare of our youth
                    Excessive use of technology has been associated with multiple detrimental effects on
                    children. Prolonged screen time can produce “Mindless eating,” where a child is unaware of how
                    much they are consuming because they are focused on their screen. Additionally, the attention
                    span of children is greatly reduced due to the readiness of media because of advances in
                    technology. As outlined in an article by National University, a research study in Canada revealed
                    that the average attention span dropped from roughly 12 seconds to only eight seconds.
                    Academic performance may also suffer due to this loss of attention span, as children are less
                    likely to focus on their studies. While acknowledging the benefits of technology, parents must
                    establish a healthy balance and employ measures to help relieve the negative impacts on their
                    children's health and well-being.
                    In its infancy, social media had much fewer users who regulated their time off the
                    internet much more successfully than today’s users. Today, 97 percent of teenagers use at least
                    one major social media outlet, and 47 percent are online almost constantly, according to
                    Mayoclinic.org. The average workday for a student in the teenage age range is about eight
                    hours including transportation to and from school while the recommended sleep for a student of
                    this age is eight to ten hours each night. This allots only a few hours for any teenager to use
                    social media; however, any student spending more than six to eight hours on social media is
                    sacrificing time that should be put to learning or sleeping. This addiction negatively impacts the
                    lives of the teenagers by diminishing their grades as a result of them dedicating more time to
                    social media rather than academics, and physically affects them due to the teenagers dedicating
                    time to social media that they should be using to rest.
